CS35L Week6 Homework
======
1. Yes. All communication across the network is encrypted using a common session
   key for the particular ssh session. As such, the attacker will not be able to
   make sense of the bytes being transferred across the network. The network is
   still technically compromised, however, as the attacker may read any other
   information not sent across encrypted/secure channels.
   1) The attacker would be able to see all commands typed by the clients, but
      less a client types sensitive information into the shell (e.g. a password
      for superuser access), the network is still not compromised as ssh has been
      set up to use key based authentication, and as such without the key, the
      attacker will not be able to gain shell access into either computers.
   2) In such a scenario, as the attacker has had access the private keys of the
      client, the network is compromised as the attacker is now able to prove
      their identity using the compromised private key.

2. `gpg --verify` checks if the data has been tampered with/changed using
   the file sender's public key since it was last signed by the rightful
   distributer using his private key. However, this does not prevent a malicious
   attacker from signing and distributing the file with his own set of keys,
   as we can only verify the integrity, but not necessarily the origin of the file.
   A good solution would be to use a trusted certificate authority to distribute
   and manage the public keys, and warn users when the file is found to be
   accompanied by an unverified/unidentified public key.
