======
(on the remote computer)
1. `ssh-keygen`
  - Generates the ssh private and public key for the server
2. `sudo useradd -d /home/cs35ssh -m cs35ssh;
    sudo passwd cs35ssh`
  - Creates an account for the client user (i.e. me) on the server
3. `cd /home/cs35ssh; sudo mkdir .ssh`
  - Creates a `.ssh` directory for the new user
4. `sudo chown -R cs35ssh .ssh;
    sudo chmod 700 .ssh`
  - Reassigns permissions for the `.ssh` directory for the newly created user
(on local)
5. `ssh-keygen`
  - Generates the ssh private and public keys for the client
6. `ssh-copy-id -i cs35ssh@45.55.176.213`
  - Copies the client's public key to the server, which adds it as an
    authorized key.
7. `ssh-add`
  - Adds the private key to ssh-agent, allowing it to protect and manage
    the private key
8. `ssh -X cs35ssh@45.55.176.213`
  - ssh to the remote server, with X11 forwarding enabled.
9. `xterm`
  - Ensure X11 forwarding is working correctly
