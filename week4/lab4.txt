CS35L Week 4 Lab
======
1. `git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git`
  - Clones/downloads the remote git repository to local
2. `cd diffutils ; git log > ../git-log.txt`
  - Outputs a log of git commits and saves it to `git-log.txt`
3. `git tag > ../git-tags.txt`
  - Outputs a file with the list of tags used for diffutils.
4. `cat git-log.txt | grep -A 10 -B 10 "maint: quote"`
  - Use grep to find the commit hash with the specified title.
    The hash is `62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f`.
5. `cd diffutils; git format-patch -1 62ca21c8c1 --stdout >
    ../quote-patch.txt`
  - Uses `git format-patch` to create the patch file from
    the specified commit. `-1` limits it to the topmost
    commit.
6. `git checkout v3.0`
  - Check out version 3.0 of Diffutils. Switches current
    branch to a temporal branch without a HEAD. Commits will
    not be retained.
7. `patch -p1 -i ../quote-patch.txt`
  - Patches diffutils using the generated patch file. A number of files
    were not found and the patch is skipped: `HACKING, doc/diffutils.texi,
    man/help2man`. Patching failed at one or more hunks for some files:
    `src/diff3.c, src/diff.c, README, README-hacking, cfg.mk`. Files
    with failed patching have the rejects saved to a separate file.
8. `git status`    
  - The following files were modified:
    ```
    modified:   NEWS
    modified:   README
    modified:   TODO
    modified:   doc/diagmeet.note
    modified:   ms/config.bat
    modified:   ms/config.site
    modified:   po/en.po
    modified:   src/analyze.c
    modified:   src/cmp.c
    modified:   src/context.c
    modified:   src/diff.c
    modified:   src/diff.h
    modified:   src/diff3.c
    modified:   src/dir.c
    modified:   src/ifdef.c
    modified:   src/io.c
    modified:   src/sdiff.c
    modified:   src/side.c
    modified:   src/system.h
    modified:   src/util.c
    modified:   tests/help-version
    ```
    and the following files were added, and untracked:
    ```
    NEWS.orig
    README-hacking.orig
    README-hacking.rej
    README.orig
    README.rej
    cfg.mk.orig
    cfg.mk.rej
    ms/config.site.orig
    src/cmp.c.orig
    src/context.c.orig
    src/diff.c.orig
    src/diff.c.rej
    src/diff.h.orig
    src/diff3.c.orig
    src/diff3.c.rej
    src/dir.c.orig
    src/sdiff.c.orig
    src/system.h.orig
    src/util.c.orig
    tests/help-version.orig
    ```
9. `emacs src/util.c`
  - `C-x v =` shows the diff between the current blob and the index,
    and shows the diff file on a new buffer.
  - `C-x v u` reverts the modified blob to the state on the index.
  - In the diff buffer:
    `C-c C-a` applies the current selected hunk of the diff, with an
    option to revert if already applied.
    `C-c C-c` goes to the location in file of the selected hunk.
10. `C-x C-f [file]`
  - Opens the file which has unwanted changes.
11. `C-x v u y Enter`
  - Reverts the modified blob. The following files has their changes
    reverted:
    ```
    modified:   NEWS
    modified:   README
    modified:   TODO
    modified:   doc/diagmeet.note
    modified:   ms/config.bat
    modified:   ms/config.site
    modified:   po/en.po
    modified:   src/diff.h
    modified:   src/system.h
    ```
12. Using emacs and `C-x v u, C-x c-a`, changes other than those to
    character string constants are removed. The files that remain
    with changes are:
    ```
    modified:   src/cmp.c
    modified:   src/diff.c
    modified:   src/diff3.c
    modified:   src/dir.c
    modified:   src/sdiff.c
    modified:   src/util.c
    ```
13. The rejected, unapplied hunks were examined and the relevant
    files (`diff.c, diff3.c`) were manually patched with the necessary
    changes.
14. `git clean -f`
  - Removes all untracked files from disk.
15. `git diff > ../quote-3.0-patch.txt`
  - Creates a patch file from the existing modifications.
16. `./bootstrap; ./configure; make `
  - Builds `diffutils` according to `README-hacking`
17. `src/diff . -; diff --help`
  - Checks that the newly built `diff` does what its expected to.
    Grave accent characters are now absent.
18. `cd ..; mv diffutils diffutils-3.0-patch;
     git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git;
     mv diffutils diffutils-3.0;
     git checkout v3.0; cd ..;
     diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch
     >quote-3.0-test.txt`
  - Clone a fresh copy of the repository, and check out v3.0 on that.
19. `diff quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt`
  - The files have differences within the `.git` directory which git uses,
    and a few lines in the second file had line breaks before the line was
    finished, possibly artifacts from editing in emacs. But none of the
    differences seem particularly dangerous.
