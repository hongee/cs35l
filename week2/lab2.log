CS35L Lab 2
======
1) `cat /usr/share/dict/words | sort -u > words`
- sorts the shared `words` file by line and outputs it to `words`

2) `curl -O http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring16/cs35L/assign/assign2.html`
- downloads the html file to the current directory

3) `cat assign2.html | tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' > output1`
- translates every non alphabetical character into a newline character

4) `cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' > output2`
- translates every non alphabetical character into a newline, squeezing
repeated sequences of such characters replacing them with only one newline.

5) `cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort`
- this does the same as above, except it also sorts the output alphabetically

6) `cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u`
- this does the same as above, except it only keeps a unique copy of each
line from the `tr` output

7) `cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words`
- this pipes the output from above and compares them against the file `words`,
displaying the lines unique to each file, and lines that appear in both files

8) `cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words`
- same as above, but shows only lines that appear in both files

9) `wget http://mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdseng.htm`
- retrieves the hawaiian html file

10) `cat hwnwdseng.htm | ./buildwords > hwords`
- this runs buildwords on the hawaiian html file and pipes the
output to hwords

10) `cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
     | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
     | sort -u | comm -23 - hwords > hawaiianmis`
    `wc -l hawaiianmis`
- running the spellchecker using the hawaiian dictionary gives 399 misspelt
words on the assignment html page

10) `cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
     | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
     | sort -u | comm -23 - words > nmis`
    `wc -l nmis`
- running the spellchecker using the english dictionary gives 15 misspelt
words on the assignment html page

11) `cat hwords | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
     | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
     | sort -u | comm -23 - hwords`
- running the hawaiian spellchecker on itself will result in 45 misspelt
words as `tr` removes the apostrophes "'". Including the character to the
first set fixes this problem

12) `comm nmis hawaiianmis`
- the entire set of misspelt english words were marked as misspelt in
hawaiian, so there are no words misspelt as english that were not misspelt
as hawaiian, and the difference between the two sets are the words
misspelt as hawaiian but not in english - e.g. web, utilities, user etc.
