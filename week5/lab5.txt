CS35L Week 5 Lab
======
1. `curl -O http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring16/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz`
  - Downloads the tar ball containing the buggy coreutils.
2. `tar -xzf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz ; cd coreutils-with-bug`
  - Extracts the contents of the downloaded archive.
3. `./configure ; make`
  - Builds the buggy coreutils as is. The build failed, with the error:
  ```
  In file included from utimecmp.c:41:
  utimens.h:2: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'
  /usr/include/sys/stat.h:374: note: previous declaration of 'futimens' was here
  ```
  - The `utimens.h` header file declares a function signature for the function `futimens`,
    and a function of the same name seems to now be built in to the standard library, which
    differs in implementation, and hence causing the build to fail.
4. `cd .. ; curl -O http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring16/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff`
  - Downloads the patch
